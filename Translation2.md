Deianira, uxor Herculis, flumen magnum, cui nomen Evenus erat, non poterat transire, et centaurum Nessum, qui filius Ixionis et Nubis erat, auxilium rogavit. Hic Deianiram sublatam in flumine ipso uiolare uoluit. huc Hercules cum interuenisset et Deianira cum fidem eius implorasset, Nessum sagittis confixit.

ille moriens, cum sciret sagittas Hydrae Lernaeae felle tinctas magnam vim habere, sanguinem suum exceptum Deianirae dedit et id philtrum esse dixit.

B. Grammatical questions

Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)
> antecedent: flumen magnum, masucline singular
> dative, functioning as relative pronoun expressing possession within the clause

Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.
> present active infinitive
> used in this clause because it is not modifying or clarifying anything about the subject, but part of the independent clause.

sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.
> feminine, accusative, singular, perfect passive participle.
> >tollo, sustŭli, sublātum

Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?
> feminine dative plural, functions as indirect object.

Identify the form of moriens.
> neuter, nominative, singular, active present participle

Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?
> ablative singular of fel. It is being modified by a participle, so it takes the ablative form.

> ablative feminine singular perfect passive participle

Identify the form of exceptum.
> accusative masculine singular perfect passive participle

William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.
