A. Grammatical analysis
Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.


 Augeae regis stercus bobile 
>uno die *purgavit*, 
maiorem partem 
>Iove adiutore; 

flumine admisso 
>totum stercus *abluit*.

 taurum 
> cum quo Pasiphae concubuit ex Creta insula 
Mycenis vivum *adduxit*.

 Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, 
>qui carne humana vescebantur, 
cum Abdero famulo *interfecit*; 

>equorum autem nomina 
Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

B. Grammatical questions

In the phrase, Iove adiutore, what case is Iove? What kind of construction is this phrase?
>Iove is ablative and with adiutore in the ablative, it is an ablative absolute construction to independently express Iuppiter as helper.

What case is stercus, and why is it in that case?
>stercus is accusative because it expresses that Hercules was performing an action upon it (cleaning).

Identify the form of the adjective maiorem (gender, case, number, degree).
>neuter, accusative, singular, comparative

Explain the construction of the verbal unit flumine admisso.
>flumine is ablative of flumen and admisso is the ablative participle of admissus, so it expresses that he was able to clean it "with the river being let in/allowed to flow".

What are the gender, number, case, and antecedent of qui?
>masculine, plural, nominative, and "equos quattuor eius" or simply "equos".

What Latin verb form has to be understood in the clause that runs from equorum to Dinus?
>participles. They are formed from a verb but used as an adjective and each name is used to describe the horses.

C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passageâ€™s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

> One way that Hyginus complements the meaning of the passage is in the phrase "*qui carne humana vescebantur*" in which the idea of the horses eating human flesh is expressed as "by/with human flesh they were fed" although vescor is deponent. However, I believe this was intentional as carne is ablative. Another instance would be the use of "*maiorem partem Iove adiutore*" as it helps to clarify that although Hercules was helped by Iove, he was not given help for the entire duration of the horrible task.
