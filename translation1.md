A. Grammatical analysis
Place each clause on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each clause by surrounding it with asterisks. For example, if you were given the English sentence, “They felt relieved when they realized that the translation was easy.”, you could write that in markdown as

C.Translation
>When Hercules had come to the place of King Dexamenus and deflowered his daughter, Deianira, he wanted her to be his wife. When Hercules was away, the centaur, Eurytion, asked for Deianira as a wife. Because her father feared centaurs, he promised to give her to him. For a fixed period of time, the centaur came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules intervened and killed the centaur and carried Deianira away.
